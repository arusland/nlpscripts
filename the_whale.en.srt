It's not a cult.

Tell you one thing
that I like about religion.

703
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:52,842
What I like about religion

704
00:42:52,877 --> 00:42:54,976
is that it assumes
that everyone is an idiot

705
00:42:55,011 --> 00:42:56,945
and that they're all incapable
of saving themselves.

706
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,683
I think they got
something right with that.

707
00:42:58,718 --> 00:42:59,849
I don't think like that...

708
00:42:59,884 --> 00:43:01,719
What I don't like
about religion

709
00:43:01,754 --> 00:43:04,183
is that when people
accept Jesus or whatever,

710
00:43:04,218 --> 00:43:05,855
they suddenly think
that they're better

711
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:06,956
than everyone else.

that they're stupid sinners,

713

So...

733
00:43:55,336 --> 00:43:57,907
Christ's return
has been promised
for centuries.

734
00:43:57,942 --> 00:43:59,304
But there are a lot
of clues in Scripture

735
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:00,505
that suggest it's imminent.

736
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,912

we don't have time

gonna end soon?

that no one shall know the day

741
00:44:09,921 --> 00:44:11,349
yeah, I think we're probably
living in end times.

And that doesn't bother you?

743

No. It's the idea

to replace this one.

is gonna be wiped clean,

It's God's plan.

876
00:50:53,752 --> 00:50:57,128
But there are
other types of people.

877
00:50:57,163 --> 00:50:58,393
People like Charlie,

878
00:50:58,428 --> 00:51:01,627
for whom this amazing plan
doesn't fit.

879
00:51:02,696 --> 00:51:05,829
So, just stay away from him.

880
00:51:05,864 --> 00:51:07,303
He doesn't need this
right now.

881
00:51:09,637 --> 00:51:11,373
I disagree.

882
00:51:11,408 --> 00:51:14,145
(EXHALES) Excuse me?
Sorry, I just, uh...

883
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,542
He's dying.

884
00:51:15,577 --> 00:51:17,181
He's refusing
to go to the hospital.

885
00:51:17,216 --> 00:51:18,743
What he needs
is spiritual guidance.

886
00:51:18,778 --> 00:51:20,250
And you're gonna
give him that?

887
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:22,285
No. God will.

888
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:26,124
I see.

889
00:51:45,244 --> 00:51:47,343
My big brother
did some missionary work
for New Life.

890
00:51:49,413 --> 00:51:50,643
Went to South America.

891
00:51:51,448 --> 00:51:53,613
Oh.
Yeah.

892
00:51:53,648 --> 00:51:54,614
I was the black sheep.

893
00:51:54,649 --> 00:51:57,254
I refused to go to church
ever since I was 12.

894
00:51:58,290 --> 00:51:59,685
Dad knew
I was a lost cause,

895
00:52:02,228 --> 00:52:06,230
but not my brother,
he loved New Life.

896
00:52:06,265 --> 00:52:08,331
He wrote me a letter
a few months after he left,

897
00:52:08,366 --> 00:52:10,465
told me he was tired,

898
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,928
and lonely, but he didn't
want to come home

899
00:52:11,963 --> 00:52:13,402
because he didn't want
to get married.

900
00:52:14,438 --> 00:52:15,602
He didn't want to get married?

901
00:52:15,637 --> 00:52:17,406
Dad had set it all up.

902
00:52:17,441 --> 00:52:18,407
Pushed him
into getting married

903
00:52:18,442 --> 00:52:21,806
to this girl from the church
he barely knew.

904
00:52:21,841 --> 00:52:24,380
But when he came back,
he met someone else.

905
00:52:24,415 --> 00:52:26,415
Fell in love,
started a whole new life.

906
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:29,484
And Dad kicked him out
of the church.

907
00:52:30,388 --> 00:52:31,420
And the family.

908
00:52:33,292 --> 00:52:34,522
I thought he was gonna be able

909
00:52:34,557 --> 00:52:36,590
to get over
all that religious stuff,

910
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:39,890
but it was like a cancer.

911
00:52:39,925 --> 00:52:42,464
He couldn't shake it.

912
00:52:42,499 --> 00:52:44,301
He just caved in on himself,

913
00:52:44,336 --> 00:52:45,764
stopped sleeping,
stopped eating.

914
00:52:45,799 --> 00:52:46,930
Lost a ton of weight.

915
00:52:48,637 --> 00:52:50,505
One night,
he doesn't come home.

916
00:52:52,641 --> 00:52:54,542
Couple weeks later,
this guy is out jogging

917
00:52:54,577 --> 00:52:56,379
on a bike path
near the river in Lewiston,

918
00:52:56,414 --> 00:52:57,974
sees something washed up
on shore,

919
00:52:58,009 --> 00:52:59,811
and that was Alan.

920
00:53:02,288 --> 00:53:04,453
The love of Charlie's life,
and my brother.

921
00:53:05,951 --> 00:53:08,391
Oh.
Yeah. "Oh."

922
00:53:08,426 --> 00:53:10,921
To this day,
my dad won't admit it.

923
00:53:10,956 --> 00:53:13,462
Told the whole congregation
Alan's death was...

924
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,433
just an unfortunate accident.

925
00:53:20,064 --> 00:53:22,834

926
00:53:31,845 --> 00:53:34,813
Look, I know
that you don't trust me.

927
00:53:34,848 --> 00:53:37,486
And I know
that I haven't known him
for very long,

928
00:53:37,521 --> 00:53:40,456
but I really think
that God brought me here,

929
00:53:40,491 --> 00:53:42,656
right when Charlie
needs it the most.

930
00:53:42,691 --> 00:53:45,527
I just want him to be saved,
that's all...
You listen to me!

931
00:53:45,562 --> 00:53:46,891
He doesn't need saving!

932
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:50,565
In a few days, he's probably
going to be dead,

933
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,029
so what he needs
is for you to leave him alone.

934

who can help him.

this guy, Jerry,

1204
01:10:37,507 --> 01:10:39,067
all he had us doing
was standing on corners

and handing out pamphlets.

1206
01:10:41,071 --> 01:10:42,510

he'd be like,

1207
01:10:42,545 --> 01:10:44,039
"Look how many people
we're helping," but...

1208
01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:45,975
I tried to talk to him

1209
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:47,376
about different ways
we can minister.

1210
01:10:47,412 --> 01:10:50,716
I mean, different ways
that we could actually
help people. But...

1211
01:10:52,016 --> 01:10:54,489

that he didn't need to earn

1212

or prove his faith at all.

1213
01:10:59,023 --> 01:11:02,497

I was just, like,
"Am I really helping?"

1214
01:11:03,731 --> 01:11:05,566
No. You were not.

1215
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:08,800
Yeah, I started to feel
that way, too.

1216
01:11:10,837 --> 01:11:11,736
I don't feel that way,

1217
01:11:11,772 --> 01:11:14,036
I know that you weren't
helping people.

1218
01:11:14,071 --> 01:11:15,444
It doesn't help people
to tell them

1219
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:16,676
that they should believe
in God.

1220
01:11:16,711 --> 01:11:17,776
Why would that help people?

"That's not

"Well, why not?"

that you left us.

I know.

1396
01:20:59,326 --> 01:21:01,227

that my husband
left me for a man.

1398

have to cut me out

you kept her from me
all this time?

she would hurt you.

to escape God's will.

1639

He chose his life with you
over God.

1640
01:36:20,917 --> 01:36:24,479
But this is why
he was so obsessed
with this verse.

1641
01:36:24,514 --> 01:36:26,283
He knew that he was living
in the flesh,

1642

and not in the Spirit.

1643
01:36:27,586 --> 01:36:30,925

but it's not too late for you.

1644
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:32,520

you can put to death

to be with me?

turned his back on him

that there isn't a God,

because I hate to think
that there's an afterlife,

1675
01:38:19,068 --> 01:38:22,531
